GitHub etiquette

1. Before working on anything in the project run: git pull <local instance> master
2. Make use of commit messages. Short and descriptive is best.
3. Push your changes. Since we are not all on the same schedule, this is very important.


Terminal commands:

git add .
git commit -m "insert message here"
git push <local instance name> master
git pull <local instance name> master
